# DDNS Updater

A lightweight Go application that monitors your public IP and updates your DDNS provider when changes are detected. It supports dynamic configuration reloading, graceful shutdown, and exposes a health check endpoint following Docker health check conventions.

## Features

- **Dynamic DDNS Updating:**  
  Periodically checks your public IP (via [api.ipify.org](https://api.ipify.org)) and updates your DDNS record if the IP changes.

- **Configurable:**  
  Loads settings from a JSON configuration file (`config/config.json`) and automatically reloads when changes are detected.

- **Health Check Endpoint:**  
  Exposes a `/health` HTTP endpoint that reports the applicationâ€™s status with a detailed JSON structure. The output includes:



  - Created: Timestamp when the application started.
  - Path: The request path (typically /health).
  - Args: The command-line arguments used to start the application.
  - State: Detailed health state including:
    - Status: Indicates whether the application is "starting", "healthy", or "unhealthy".
    - FailingStreak: The count of consecutive failed IP update attempts.
    - Log: A list of recent log entries, each containing:
      - Start: Timestamp when the health check started.
      - End: Timestamp when the health check ended.
      - ExitCode: Exit code (0 for success, 1 for failure).
      - Output: A message indicating the outcome of the check.




- **Graceful Shutdown:**  
  Listens for interrupt signals (Ctrl+C) and shuts down cleanly.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16+ (or newer)
- Git (if building from source)
- [fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) Go package

## Installation

**Clone the repository (if applicable):**

```
git clone https://github.com/danho-de/ddns-updater.git
cd your-ddns-updater
```

## Configuration

**Create a configuration file at config/config.json with the following structure:**

  ```
    {
    "user": "your-username",
    "pass": "your-password",
    "ddns": "your-ddns-server.com",
    "interval": 300,
    "health_port": 8080
    }
  ```

- user: Your DDNS service username.
- pass: Your DDNS service password.
- ddns: The DDNS service endpoint (host/path) used in the update URL.
- interval: Update interval in seconds (defaults to 300 seconds if set below 1).
- health_port: Port for the health check HTTP server (defaults to 8080 if not provided).

## Build Instructions

A build script (build.sh) is provided to format and compile the application with a build number derived from the git commit history. The build is statically linked for Linux using CGO_ENABLED=0.

To build the application, simply run:

```
./build.sh
```

This script will produce a binary named ddns-updater.

## Running the Application

1- Ensure the configuration file is in place at config/config.json.

2- Start the application:

  ```
  ./ddns-updater
  ```


The application will:

- Monitor your public IP.
- Update your DDNS record when a change is detected.
- Watch for configuration file changes and reload settings automatically.
- Expose a health check endpoint

## Health Check

The health check HTTP server starts on the port specified in config.json (or defaults to 8080). To check the status of the application, send a GET request to:

```
    http://localhost:8080/health
```

The JSON response includes:

  ```
  {
    "Created": "2024-05-20T07:50:50.644083882Z",
    "Path": "/health",
    "Args": [
      "./ddns-updater",
      "--some-flag"
    ],
    "State": {
      "Status": "healthy",
      "FailingStreak": 0,
      "Log": [
        {
          "Start": "2021-09-07T06:10:05.233163051Z",
          "End": "2021-09-07T06:10:07.585487343Z",
          "ExitCode": 0,
          "Output": "DDNS updated successfully with IP: 1.2.3.4"
        }
        // ... additional log entries ...
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

- Created: The timestamp when the application started.
- Path: The endpoint path (typically /health).
- Args: Command-line arguments used to run the application.
- State: Includes the current health status, the number of consecutive failures, and a log of recent health checks.


## Docker Deployment

The repository includes a Dockerfile for containerizing the application. The Docker build uses a multi-stage process:

1. Alpine Stage:
   Installs CA certificates in Alpine.

2. Scratch Stage:
   Copies the CA certificates from Alpine into a minimal scratch image along with the ddnsclddns-updaterient binary and configuration files.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run:

```
    docker build -t ddns-updater .
```

## Running the Docker Container

```
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name ddns-updater ddns-updater
```

If you have specified a different health_port in your configuration, adjust the port mapping accordingly.

Note:
You can also configure a Docker health check using this endpoint. For example, in your Dockerfile, you could add:

```
   HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```
